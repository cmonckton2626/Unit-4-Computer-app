##  Realizations Along the Development Journey
During my time this week working on the project I found out just how much I have learned in the previous weeks. I was surprised to see how more comfortable I felt writing the code and language, and how much more sense it truly made to me compared to previous projects. 

##  Next Steps
&#9744; Implement user picture upload to share computer build pictures. 
<br>
&#9744; Add a field a response to a computer stress test for users to share, and make graphs or other visual interpretaions of the data
